 <h1>The Best Movies According to Aryan</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>Makes me feel some kind of way, I always wanted to be an Astronaut.</p>
 <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
 <p>Can't go wrong with this one, probably the highest rated IMDb movie that I have watched.</p>
 <h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
 <p>All Spider-Man movies are goated, but this new comic style animation has something about itself. "IMMA DO MY OWN THING".</p>
